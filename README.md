# 2019 Deep Learning Fundamentals and Applications in Medical Informatics Workshop

My name is Ahmad, and I have the honor to serve as a speaker at [Deep Learning Fundamentals and Applications in Medical Informatics](https://web.cvent.com/event/472ac73b-360b-4c5a-a45d-d14cc0249321/summary), which is being held in [Northwestern Mutual Cream City Labs](https://innovation.northwesternmutual.com/cream-city-labs/), April, 5-6, 2019.  

I will be covering two topics, including: <strong> 1) AI and deep learning; what and why? </strong> and <strong> 2) Deep CNN architectures and their applications in medical image analysis </strong>.  The PDF files of these topics are available within the current GitHub repository. I am trying my level best to document everything around my talks within this GitHub repository. 

##  Hands-on-practice (Python, TensorFlow, Keras)
The talk in Deep CNN architectures will include a hands-on-practice on anomaly detection of chest x-ray images using a publicly available dataset. We, together, will combine several deep CNN architectural models to do the task in an ensemble fashion. We will look at the work as a classifiocation problem, meaning that we will classify different pathologies within chest x-ray images, where we also have healthy chest x-rays. In the workshop, I will be ustilizing [<strong>Google Colab</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) equipped with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and GPUs to first develpo the pipeline, and then train, validate, and test the contructed models. Using Google Colab, you don't need to install any software/library packages, and as you know better than me, everything is just ready to use. Thanks much, Google! 

I would strongly recommend you to go through the [<strong>Google Colab</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), but in case you would like to do the hands-on-practice on your local machine, there exists an instruction too.
